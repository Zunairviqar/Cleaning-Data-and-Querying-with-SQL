5. Can You Use this Data Set for Your Intended Use Case? 
Yes, since I am not reproducing the data and only performing an analysis on it, adhering similarly to the data set that we used in workshop 2.


## Table Design
The design of the table is such that it has 10 columns.

The PRIMARY KEY has been chosen as a combination of two columns, namely the year and the code. This is because the combination of each of these should be unique, such that each state should appear only once in each year allowing this to be a unique value and a relevant candidate for the primary key.

The first column is 'year' and has values for the year that the data has been collected on. The sample value is '1975'. This value is stored as an integer since the year cannot have any character other than digits.

The second column is 'code' and has values for the state code for the state that the data is for.  The sample value is 'WASPD00'. This value is stored as text since the code is a combination of digits and string characters so it is most appropriate to store it as a text value.

The third column is 'state' and has values for the state that the data is for. The sample value is 'SanJose'. This value is stored as text since the name of the country only contains string characters.

The fourth column is 'acronym' and has values for the acronym of the state name. The sample value is 'NM'. This value is stored as text since the acronym of the country only contains string characters.

The fifth column is 'population' and has values for the population of the state. The sample value is '529675'. This value is stored as an integer since the population number can only be an integer and could be used for numeric calculations.

The sixth column is 'violent_crimes' and has values for the number of violent crimes committed in the state for the year. The sample value is '2383'. This value is stored as an integer since the violent crimes number can only be an integer and could be used for numeric calculations.

The seventh column is 'homicides' and has values for the number of homicides committed in the state for the year. The sample value is '30'. This value is stored as an integer since the homicides number can only be an integer and could be used for numeric calculations.

The eighth column is 'rapes' and has values for the number of rapes committed in the state for the year. The sample value is '181'. This value is stored as an integer since the number of rapes can only be an integer and could be used for numeric calculations.

The ninth column is 'assaults' and has values for the number of assaults committed in the state for the year. The sample value is '1353'. This value is stored as an integer since the number of assaults can only be an integer and could be used for numeric calculations.

The tenth column is 'robberies' and has values for the number of robberies committed in the state for the year. The sample value is '819'. This value is stored as an integer since the number of robberies can only be an integer and could be used for numeric calculations.

## Import
Importing the data was no doubt the most time consuming part as it was what the entire assignment was dependent upon. I was having difficulties initially but i figured that it was mainly because the file to be imported was probably within a folder of my working directory and it was giving me an error and so I used an absolute path for the 'crimes_committed.csv' file which allowed it to be imported.

## Database Information
sqlite> .tables
Reports

```
### 1. show all of the tables in your database (there should only be 1!)
The Command that I used for this was:

.sqlite> .tables

(RESULT WAS:)

Reports
```

```
### 2. show information about the table's columns (names and types)
The Command that I used for this was:

.sqlite> .schema

(RESULT WAS:)

CREATE TABLE Reports (
    year integer NOT NULL,
    code text NOT NULL,
    state text,
    acronym text,
    population integer,
    violent_crimes integer,
    homicides integer,
    rapes integer,
    assaults integer,
    robberies integer,
    PRIMARY KEY(year, code)
);
```


## Query Results


```
### 1. do some rudimentary data cleaning by modifying values in a column or columns (such as change '' to NULL, cast types, etc.) â€¦ instead of adding the results of the query or queries to report.md, write the motivation for modifying / cleaning your data in this way

***PRODUCES NO OUTPUT***
```

```
### 2. the total number of rows in the database
count(*)  
----------
2753
```
```
### 3. show the first 15 rows, but only display 3 columns (your choice)

state        population  rapes

### 8. group rows together by a column value (your choice) and use an aggregate function to calculate something about that group (count of all members of the group, the average of a column of the members of the group)
show the column that is used for grouping AND the result of the aggregate function (so, 2 columns minimum on output)

### 9. now, using the same grouping query or creating another one, find a way to filter the query results based on the values for the groups (for example, show all genres that have more than 2 movies in it and only show the genre and the number of movies for that genre).
you'll use a HAVING clause to do this (covered in the slides on group by)

### 10. Displays 3 columns, with 2 columns. One column with an aggregate of the value of data in that group and another showing the maximum from those added values. of the data It represents the total crimes committed from 1975 to 2015 in each state in the 2nd column, and the maximum total crimes in a year in a state from 1975 to 2015.
